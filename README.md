# Terminal Style Examples

Experimentation in this repository for various website design ideas that are minimalistic & represent the terminal design and TUI interfaces.

## Drafts

View the index page for links to concepts of elements that I might like.

## Functionality

For the o just  tll function, I want the menu to have a concept of the element's top so that if it is a solid bar it scrolls it down corrently & if it is a split box then it appropriately handles it. If there is a title to the block, it should convert it to just a straight line cause there may be embeddeded images, etc.
